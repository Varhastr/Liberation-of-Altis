# Liberation-of-Altis
This is the code repository for the Arma 3 mission/game mode Liberation of Altis. If you are interested in helping with coding or contributing other material, such as voice overs or cutscenes, please let me know!

The mission/game mode can be found on the steam workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2278581768
I would like to remind everyone that this version is NOT complete. As a matter of fact it's very far from complete. I will release updates whenever I feel I've fixed and/or added enough content to justify an update.

If you are wanting to help I'm currently looking for a graphic designer to create logos and thumbnails for the mission. I'm also looking for fellow developers familiar with the code used in Arma 3's Eden Editor to help create content for the mission. I'm also looking for someone familiar with creating cut scenes in Arma 3's editor.
