# Liberation-of-Altis
This is the code repository for the Arma 3 mission/game mode Liberation of Altis. If you are interested in helping with coding or contributing other material, such as voice overs or cutscenes, please let me know!

The mission/game mode can be found on the steam workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2278581768
I would like to remind everyone that this version is NOT complete. As a matter of fact it's very far from complete. I will release updates whenever I feel I've fixed and/or added enough content to justify an update.

If you are wanting to help I'm currently looking for a graphic designer to create logos and thumbnails for the mission. I'm also looking for fellow developers familiar with the code used in Arma 3's Eden Editor to help create content for the mission. I'm also looking for someone familiar with creating cut scenes in Arma 3's editor.

# Mission Description
Player will play as Colonel William Hill, a UN peace-keeper sent in response to reports of OpFor launching a hostile takeover of Altis. Due to the nature of the situation and the current relations between the UN and Altis, the UN could only send 2 Riflemen with the Colonel initially. The UN believe the Colonel and his men should be able to recruit remaining local militia by saving them from OpFor. Hill has also been authorized to seize OpFor vehicles if possible for the benefit of the mission. The end goal is to eliminate all OpFor forces on the island and return it to a free, independent state. How the player does this is largely up to them, as there is no set course of missions to follow.
